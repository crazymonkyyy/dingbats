the writing should be concise, informal and above all else written in human
the offical sytle guide has no power here
all else is not yet decided

only contributiters who join quickly will have any say 
if ive written 50 examples and you tell me to not say "the std has shitty names" in some comment about canFind I will ignore you
if you want to say "odd number lines should be tabs, even number lines should be 7 spaces" but you submitted 20 examples, welcome please write the style guide
