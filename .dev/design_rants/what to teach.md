someone gave me some shit for introducing goto so early
I imagine ill get more for not introducing classes at all

in my mind goto isnt replaceable its just a question of whats the syntax so reading 2 lines of code to see "oh goto exists" but not actaully "testing" it, is good and effective teaching

classes are like oo memes and have "new" and like reference things; I dont care to cover it cause not important :D

so like, I think whats taught should be ideally 1 way to do something but maybe hint at other things before moving on

foreach not for cause ranges and comma syntax wierd
struct not classes
std.traits not __traits or is, cause template calling syntax and no one actaully knows what is does
ranges as functions but not std.range.interfaces
int, float, bool but ideally no other base types cause if you need a 64 bit int you can just look it up, do not care about int promation rules thats just error message in the future

drop references to things worth knowing in working code but dont require understanding everything to move on
explain what your asking the user to write 2/3 ways, i.e. show a struct in the last example before asking a user to write thier own based solely off some wordy explation, 2 examples and a lazy explation better
