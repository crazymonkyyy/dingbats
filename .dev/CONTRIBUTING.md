### Educators

If you have experience teaching Id like to see *curriculum plans*. Its one thing to be told "goto will corrupt new users"(when I want to corrupt the youth), what I need is big picture orginization my current plan is in `curriculum.md` and is probaly shit.

### 1000x programmers

There are topics I think are important but I dont feel that knowlegdable about; `sumtype` comes to mind, if its on the todo list, throw whatever you wish into `unorginizedcode`.

### 2x programmers 

The main product is example code and its hard to imagine "to many" examples, ill try to mantain `newexample.sh` to create good templates and workflow for writting examples.

I would also like to make a high quality reference/cheatsheet that will need some concise code examples and summerizing parts of the spec into `unorginizedcode`.

### grammer nazis/editors

Make any changes you wish, I know how my writting is; just try to not be verbose.

### new programmers

Your experience going thru dingbats is very important, complain freely.
